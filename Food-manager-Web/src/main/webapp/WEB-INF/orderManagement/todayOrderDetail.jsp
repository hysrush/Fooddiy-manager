		<p>
			<strong>Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy</strong> text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five
			centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged.
